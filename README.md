Part #1

Create a script that should do the following:

- ask the user for their year of birth;
- ask them where they live;
- ask them what their favorite sport is.
When they click OK, we show a window that should display the following information:

- their age;
- if the user specifies Kyiv, Washington, or London, we show them the message "You live in the capital..." and in place of the dots, we substitute the country whose capital is the city. Otherwise, we show them "you live in the city...", where the dots are the entered city.
  
Part #2

- We choose three sports and three champions in these sports. However, if the user specifies one of these sports, we will show him the message “Cool! Do you want to become …?

All this should be displayed in one window (alert).

- If in any case he does not want to enter the information and clicks Cancel, show him the message – “It’s a pity that you did not want to enter your …” and indicate that he does not want to enter – date of birth, city or sport.
