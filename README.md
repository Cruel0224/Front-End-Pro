DZ 49. Simulating events via setTimeout with subscription (pub/sub)

TASK: Simulating events via setTimeout with subscription (pub/sub) — without Promises and async/await

Goal: implement the simplest event bus in the browser that can subscribe to events, unsubscribe, and emit events asynchronously via setTimeout.

Restrictions:

- Browser JavaScript only.
- Prohibited: Promises, async/await, third-party libraries.
- Allowed: setTimeout, DOM events for manual inspection.

  
The interface that needs to be implemented:
- on(topic: string, handler: (payload:any) => void): () => void — subscription, returns an unsubscribe function.
- emit(topic: string, payload?: any, delay = 0): void — asynchronous emission via setTimeout with the specified delay.
- off(topic: string, handler: Function): void — unsubscribe.
